//so the diffrence between innerText and textcontent is
/*innertext will just show the values that are visible on the page
/**while textcontent will show all the text pressent in the particular tag */
//so it depend on the use case that if we wana use the display none property also so text content will help
/**
 * ont the other hand innerHTML will throw back all the comple content of the line what and all attribuets are been used
 so basically it suppor the tags not just the text
 we do have acess to select the item by query selcto
 and we can store them into the variable and even more selectoers

 */

 /*
 while selecting from query selectorAll we get back the nodelist 
 the nodelist is not a array but lit bit similar because we can use the forEach method there 
 but when it come for getelemetn byclassname we get back html collection that is not array no method can work on it
 so we do Array.from(selected element)
 it will convert it to the array list
